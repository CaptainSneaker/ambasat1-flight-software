# AmbaSat-1 Board Definitions
The JSON files in this directory define the board configuration that should be used with PlaformIO for the AmbaSat-1 picosat. The board definitions are:

* `AmbaSat-1` - This is the original board definition provided by the AmbaSat-1 makers. This definition expects the ATmega328P to be configured to use the internal clock at 1 Mhz. The ATmega328P fuses for this board are `(E:FE, H:D6, L:62)`, and it runs the [MiniCore boot loader](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore).
* `AmbaSat-1b` - This board definition enables the use of the external 4 MHz resonator on the AmbaSat-1 picosat and a BOD of 1.8V. Note that you need to update the ATmega328P's fuses and boot loader to use this board definition. The ATmega328P fuses for this board are `(E:FE, H:D6, L:F7)`, and it runs the [MiniCore boot loader](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore). This board configuration is required in order to enable command downlinks to the AmbaSat-1.
